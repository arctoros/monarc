# monarc

This is an adapted version of the [Apple II Monitor](https://github.com/The8BitEnthusiast/apple-1-breadboard/tree/main/beneater/msbasic) by [The8BitEnthusiast](https://github.com/The8BitEnthusiast), which is itself an adapted version of the [Apple II Monitor](https://github.com/jefftranter/6502/tree/master/asm/Apple%5D%5BMonitor) by [Jeff Tranter](https://github.com/jefftranter).  

I formatted it, cleaned it up and adapted it for the arc65, for my version of the [BE6502](https://github.com/beneater/msbasic).
